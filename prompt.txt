take a look at the log files in this dir

there are three directories
baseline
drwxr-xr-x  7 stachurski users 4.0K Jul 10 15:28 v0.8.0-beta.2
drwxr-xr-x  7 stachurski users 4.0K Jul 10 15:46 v0.8.0-beta.2-with-n0-infra

the last directory is the same version of v0.8.0-beta.2 plus adding n0 hosted infra. this will hopefully be less buggy than the v0.8.0-beta.2 runs since that's only our self-hosted iroh infra

each directory has multiple test runs
the baseline directory is what we're working off of. that's the additional context, now read the rest of the prompt generated by another instance of claude. you may need to adapt some things with the new context. please let me know your plan before you proceed

For subsequent analysis runs, use the following prompt:

Please analyze the fedimint log files in this directory to identify regressions between v0.7.2 (baseline) and v0.8.0-beta.2.

Directory structure:
- baseline/ - Contains v0.7.2 logs from multiple baseline runs
- v0.8.0-beta.2/ - Contains v0.8.0-beta.2 logs with self-hosted iroh infra
- v0.8.0-beta.2-with-n0-infra/ - Contains v0.8.0-beta.2 logs with both self-hosted + n0 hosted iroh infra
- v0.8.0-beta.2-n0-only-infra/ - Contains v0.8.0-beta.2 logs with only n0 hosted iroh infra

Each directory contains:
- docker-logs-fedimint-cli-[version]-[timestamp].log
- docker-logs-fedimintd-peer0-[version]-[timestamp].log

Please perform the following analysis:

1. **Baseline Analysis** (for each baseline/run-* directory)
   - Count ERROR/WARN messages in v0.7.2 logs
   - Note any existing issues (e.g., "disco box" errors)
   - Record fedimint-cli join duration (first to last timestamp in CLI logs - this measures time to join a new client)
   - Calculate average baseline metrics across all runs

2. **Test Run Analysis** (for each test-run-* directory)
   - Count ERROR/WARN messages
   - Track key regression patterns:
     * DNS resolution failures (*.dns.iroh.link domains)
     * PKarr protocol errors ("pkarr publish error")
     * Disco box errors ("failed to open disco box")
     * Connection failures
     * Relay server issues
   - Calculate fedimint-cli join duration (first to last timestamp in CLI logs)
   - Note if join succeeded or failed

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Compare error counts between baseline and test runs
   - Identify consistent vs intermittent issues
   - Calculate performance regression (fedimint-cli join time differences)
   - Assess reproducibility of issues across test runs

4. **Summary Report**
   - List all identified regressions with severity
   - Provide success rate (successful joins / total runs)
   - Highlight any critical/blocking issues
   - Include fedimint-cli join duration comparison table

Focus on systematic issues that appear consistently across multiple test runs, as these represent true regressions rather than transient failures.
