‚óè Now I can see the complete picture! Let me create a comprehensive analysis of the performance regression and its
  causes:

  CODE PATH ANALYSIS: FEDIMINT v0.8.0-beta.2 NETWORKING PERFORMANCE REGRESSION

  Based on the code investigation, I can now explain the performance differences:

  Root Cause Analysis

  üîç Key Discovery Infrastructure Changes:

  1. v0.8.0-beta.2 Original (Self-Hosted):
  // Uses custom DNS servers for pkarr discovery
  for iroh_dns in iroh_dns_servers {
      builder = builder
          .add_discovery({
              let iroh_dns = iroh_dns.clone();
              move |sk: &SecretKey| Some(PkarrPublisher::new(sk.clone(), iroh_dns))
          })
          .add_discovery(|_| Some(PkarrResolver::new(iroh_dns)));
  }
  2. Mixed Infrastructure:
  // Adds n0's infrastructure PLUS self-hosted
  builder = builder.discovery_n0();
  // Plus the custom DNS servers (self-hosted)
  3. N0-Only Infrastructure:
  // ONLY uses n0's optimized infrastructure
  builder = builder.discovery_n0();
  // Self-hosted infrastructure is commented out

  Performance Impact Analysis

  üöÄ Why N0-Only Infrastructure is Fastest:

  1. Optimized n0 DNS Infrastructure:
    - Uses https://dns.iroh.link/pkarr (production) or staging-dns.iroh.link/pkarr (staging)
    - Centralized, reliable service with caching
    - No DHT interaction required - direct HTTP requests
    - Well-maintained infrastructure by the n0 team
  2. Single Discovery Path:
    - No competing discovery mechanisms
    - No DNS resolution conflicts
    - Consistent latency characteristics

  üêå Why Self-Hosted Infrastructure is Slowest:

  1. Custom DNS Server Issues:
    - Self-hosted iroh_dns_servers appear to have DNS resolution problems
    - PKarr protocol errors in logs indicate infrastructure instability
    - Higher latency due to additional network hops
  2. DHT Dependency:
    - Still uses discovery_dht() which requires Mainline DHT lookups
    - Variable performance based on DHT network conditions
    - Multiple discovery attempts before fallback

  üîÑ Why Mixed Infrastructure is Intermediate:

  1. Discovery Race Conditions:
    - Multiple discovery services compete
    - First successful discovery wins, but creates overhead
    - Resource contention between n0 and self-hosted services
  2. Increased Error Rates:
    - Highest error count (12) due to conflicts between systems
    - PKarr protocol errors from both systems trying to publish

  Technical Deep Dive

  PKarr Protocol Performance:

  - PKarr (Public-Key Addressable Resource Records) is the core discovery mechanism
  - n0's infrastructure (dns.iroh.link) is optimized for this workload
  - Self-hosted DNS appears to have resolution issues causing fallbacks

  Connection Establishment Flow:

  1. Node lookup via PKarr (this is where the regression occurs)
  2. QUIC connection establishment
  3. API handshake
  4. Federation join response

  The 44-56% regression in n0-only suggests there are still underlying performance issues in v0.8.0-beta.2 beyond
  just infrastructure, but the 400%+ regression with self-hosted is clearly infrastructure-related.

  Recommendations for Investigation

  1. üî• Immediate: Use n0-only infrastructure for production
  2. üîç Investigate: The remaining 44% regression in n0-only config
  3. üõ†Ô∏è Debug: Self-hosted DNS infrastructure configuration
  4. üìä Monitor: PKarr protocol error patterns

  The code analysis confirms that the infrastructure choice is the primary factor in the performance regression,
  with n0's optimized PKarr relay being significantly more reliable than self-hosted alternatives.
